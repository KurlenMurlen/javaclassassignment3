# javaclassassignment3

Yet another java class assignment. This time having to deal with the famous sort algorithm.

------SPECIFICATIONS GIVEN TO ME AND MY TEAM-----------------
In this activity, the team should add one more search strategy to the TDE4(javaclassassignment2) code: Sorting + Binary Search.

The strategy consists of sorting the table, originally generated randomly, and then searching for the elements using a binary search.

What should be implemented:

Implement a sorting algorithm of your choice and apply it to the table, recording the sorting time.

Implement a binary search algorithm and apply it to the keys searched in TDE4, recording the search time.

At the end, in addition to the Binary Search Tree and Hash Table times, present the Binary Search time (Sorting + Search).
